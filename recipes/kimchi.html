    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Preparing The Cabbage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If the cabbage cores stick out too much, trim them down a bit and discard.</li>
        <li>Chop the cabbage lengthways into quarters, then chop your quarters into 1-2 inch long pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the cabbage in a large bowl and quickly rinse it, then salt it <strong>heavily</strong></li>
        <li>Give the cabbage a vigorous toss and squeeze, then leave it to sit for up to 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing The Rest</h3>
    <ol>
    
        <li>In a small pot, combine the water and mochiko and mix well with a wooden spoon. Let it cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, until it starts to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and remove from the heat and allow it to return to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Chop the carrots, daikon and nashi into thin matchsticks. Chop the green onion, buchu, minari and leek into small rounds. Mince the saeujeot. Blend the onion, garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooled porridge into a large mixing bowl and add the garlic, ginger, onion, fish sauce, saeujeot and gochugaru. Mix until it becomes a fine paste.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the vegetables <strong>(except the cabbage)</strong> and mix well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>After up to two hours of the cabbage resting, wash the cabbage well under cold running water to remove the salt.</li>
        <li>Mix the kimchi paste with the cabbage, ensuring the cabbage is well-covered, and put it into your mason jar, tupperware or onggi.</li>
        <li>Eat it right away or leave it to ferment. Most importantly, <strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
