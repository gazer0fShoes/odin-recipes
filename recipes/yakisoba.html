    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's time for my personal favorite Japanese festival food!
    Yakisoba (Japanese stir-fried noodles) are a mainstay of any matsuri in japan, large or local.
    This quick, easy and delicious meal makes for a perfect party food, or even a lazy weekday dinner.
    And don't fret about fridge space - we won't be making as much as in the picture above!</p>
    <p><strong>serves 3</strong></p>

    <!--ingredients-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g yakisoba noodles</li>
        <li>⅓ cup yakisoba sauce (plus more to taste)</li>
        <li>340g pork belly slices</li>
        <li>½ onion</li>
        <li>½ carrot</li>
        <li>¼ green cabbage</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>3 shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>aonori <em>(optional)</em></li>
        <li>pickled red ginger <em>(optional)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <!--steps-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Freeze the pork belly slices for 10 minutes to make them easier to cut, then slice into 1 inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Slice the onion and mushrooms into strips. Julienne the carrot. Cut the green onions into long rounds. Cut the cabbage into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle, large frying pan or wok to medium heat, then add the oil.</li>
        <li>Without loosening the noodles, place them onto the griddle and flip them after they heat up. Once they are warm, gently and gradually loosen them with chopsticks to prevent them breaking up.</li>
        <li>Once the noodles have loosened up completely, transfer them to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the pork belly, season with black pepper and stir-fry until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage and shiitake and stir-fry until they are almost tender.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add the green onion and stir-fry for another minute.</li>
        <li>Return the noodles to the griddle and pour the sauce over them. Add more sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Using a pair of tongs, toss everything to combine. <strong>Make sure the noodles don't stick to the pan!</strong></li>
        <li>When the noodles are warm and everything is well-mixed, transfer the yakisoba to individual plates.</li>
        <li>Garnish with aonori and pickled red ginger <em>(both optional)</em> and, of course, <strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
