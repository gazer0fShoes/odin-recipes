    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them in half. Place them in a large pot and cover with lightly salted cold water.</li>
        <li>Boil for about 20 minutes, or until a paring knife cuts through with no resistance.</li>
        <li>Place over medium-low heat and stir gently for about a minute. This helps remove any excess water.</li>
        <li>Kill the heat and add the butter, chives and most of your cheese. The rest of the cheese will go on top when we bake it!</li>
        <li>Mash everything together and add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Finally, beat the milk and egg yolks together. If the potatoes have cooled down a bit, mix in the milk and eggs. <strong>We don't want the egg yolks to cook in the hot potatoes!!</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely mince the carrots and half onion.</li>
        <li>Brown the mince into a lightly oiled and preheated pan, then drain excess fat so that 2-3 tablespoons remain.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and saute until translucent, then add the carrots and saute for 2-3 minutes. <em>Don't worry if they're raw, they'll cook in the oven!</em></li>
        <li>Make a hole in the middle of the pan and add the garlic and tomato paste. Mix together and saute for 2-3 minutes, then add the rosemary and thyme.</li>
        <li>Add the flour to the mixture and mix until the smell of raw flour is gone and a fond has formed on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Deglaze with the Guinness and beef stock, making sure to scrape up all the fond after.</li>
        <li>Add worcestershire sauce to taste, along with the maderia and demi-glace if you're using it.</li>
        <li>Mix together until the sauce has thickened. When you drag a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan, it should leave a trail.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 175°C.</li>
        <li>Spoon the filling into your pie dish, topping with the frozen peas. Spoon the mash over the top and texture the top with a few strokes of a fork.</li>
        <li>Place the dish into your preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes. Top with more cheese and bake for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a few minutes, and <strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
